# EfficientNet Malware BIG 2015 Repository 

## About

This repository saved all research data from my final assignment research (TA) titled "Implementasi EfficientNet pada Klasifikasi Malware BIG2015". I was proposing this research at a conference with the title "Malware Classification and Visualization Using EfficientNet and B2IMG Algorithm" in [ICACSIS 2022](http://icacsis.cs.ui.ac.id/). This repository contains several things such as:
1. Research Data
2. Code
3. Images
4. Reference

## Resume

The concept of the program that I created is in three steps
1. Download the malware big 2015 dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification)
2. Using [B2IMG Algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404821003394), convert binary data into image
3. Implement EfficientNet to classify malware big 2015
4. Comparing several EfficientNet performances based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC
5. Analyze and create conclusions

## Visualized Dataset

Because the B2IMG algorithm is not under my license, I will only provide the visualized versions from the binary file of malware big 2015 within this table.

# Conclusion

This research found that the best evaluation metrics come from the EfficientNet model implemented into the RGB dataset, and EfficientNetB7 got the highest score among others. This conclusion takes from the abstract used in the proposed paper of [ICACSIS 2022](http://icacsis.cs.ui.ac.id/)

```
The growth of malware has been significantly high in the last few years. Signature-based and heuristic methods have already been used in malware classification for a long time, but since the growth of polymorphic, both methods have become irrelevant. This problem makes machine learning and deep learning popular to overcome this problem. EfficientNet is one of the transfer learning models, a deep learning subfield. It said that this model could beat the state of the art of deep learning classification in ImageNet. In this paper, the researcher implemented the EffiicientNet to classify Microsoft Malware BIG 2015 and got 99.63%, precision 98.36%, recall 98.35%, F1-Score 98.34%, and AUC 98.30%, and it only takes 10 epochs for the classification process. This research proves that EfficientNet could beat another model significantly within a few epochs.

I believe you could improve this research in many sectors, don't forget to cite this repository if you want to create a new implementation from it.

Have a Nice Code
